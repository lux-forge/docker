## Overview

This repository powers a modular homelab environment built around multi-node Docker orchestration. It supports both standalone container management and Docker Swarm deployments, with a focus on clarity, control, and operational hygiene.

The tooling here enables:

- Ease of logging to file and console (future expansion to cast to a/many endpoints) IN COLOUR.
- Future expansion, it hosts a host of comments to help even the newest of would-be homelabbers.
- Craftable Menus (CLI-based) built in Python, based on 1 parent class making subclasses clean and easy to read.
- A view of would-be useful docker containers without the need to spin all of them up. In config-friendly folders and compose files.
- A menu that already affords ability to create docker networks down to the macvlan single interface usb-passthrough-ers.
- An env-loader that casts all your env files into callable global env variables (heavily suggest this is for dev purposes only!)
- A starter to see how a swarm would work.


This project is designed for homelab operators who value modular clarity, signature-grade interfaces, and disciplined infrastructure workflows.
