Started work on the Menu classes with the idea that one class can be inherited by the rest.
- Uses a dict for each SubClass for static menu generation.
- Dynamically pushes the choices to the user by reading the dict.
- Dynamically runs the associated method based on the dict tuple it is assigned to.
- Not restricted by numbers, users can assign letters or even phrases.
- Auto-catches clashes between default exit and back beheviours and removes entries. Informs the user.
- Full support with the Logger class.
- Dynamic association with any other menus one menu calls, allows the user to select to go back.
- Exit at any point.
- Callable confirmation function with positive and negative lists for the user to select from.
- Dynamically created menu borders and boxes for a cleaner look - integrates with Colours class.
- Static dicts can be modified to change the menu look, changing colours or spaces - editable per subclass.
