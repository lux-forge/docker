- "2025-10-23": "Refactored user listing to render color-coded tables via rich. Sorted by UID and split into real users vs service accounts."
- "2025-10-23": "Enhanced user table rendering with bold red styling for sudo users. Improves visibility of privileged accounts in audit views."
- "2025-10-23": "Encapsulated user provisioning logic in User class. Supports UID/GID, shell, password, group management, SSH key generation, and known_hosts injection."
- "2025-10-22": "Initial implementation of user management module. Supports base UID/GID, shell, service accounts, group assignments, SSH key creation, and known_hosts injection."
- "2025-10-23": "Finalized PasswordEngine with max-length generation, one-per-pool guarantees, validation logic, and retry fallback. Ready for integration into user provisioning workflows."
- "2025-10-23": "Added entropy estimator to PasswordEngine. Calculates Shannon entropy based on pool size and password length for audit-grade strength scoring."
- "2025-10-24": "Integrated UID/GID assignment logic into UserGenerator. Supports fallback to next available, emits structured tags, and updates system records via usermod."
- "2025-10-24": "Refactored UID/GID assignment logic into unified set_id() method. Eliminated repetition and centralized availability checks for audit-grade hygiene."
- "2025-10-24": "Completed UserGenerator class with full provisioning flow, password integration, UID/GID fallback logic, SSH key setup, and audit tagging."
- "2025-10-24": "Enhanced UserGenerator with error handling for group assignments and SSH key generation. Logs failures and raises descriptive exceptions for robustness."
- "2025-10-24": "Resolved GID assignment error in UserGenerator. Added fallback to create missing group if GID does not exist."
- "2025-10-24": "Refactored set_id() to unify user/group creation and mutation logic. Reduced duplication and improved clarity for UID/GID assignment."
- "2025-10-24": "Provisioned testuser18 with UID/GID fallback, home directory creation, password generation, and entropy scoring. All identity pivots completed cleanly with audit-grade logging."
- "2025-10-24": "Provisioned service account 'testsvc09' with deep UID/GID fallback, restricted shell, and docker group membership. All service-mode pivots executed cleanly."
- "2025-10-24": "Transitioned from scaffolding to production-grade user creation. All identity, security, and grouping pivots validated. Ready for streamlined provisioning."
- "2025-10-24": "Created identity_has_id() to verify UID/GID alignment for users and groups. Enables skip logic and preserves identity hygiene during provisioning."
- "2025-10-24": "First successful run of userProvisioner creating a full stack of users for docker uses within the Luxforge environment. Service accounts need to not have home dirs and the odd account had the wrong shell like Plex and Jellyseer"
